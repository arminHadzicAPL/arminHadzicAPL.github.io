Welcome to my website, my name is Armin Hadzic and I work on deep learning and computer vision research. Currently, I work on computer vision applied to remote sensing. However, I am interested in most applications of deep learning and artificial intelligence. I am an Associate Researcher at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in the [Intelligent Systems Center](https://www.jhuapl.edu/isc). Formerly, I worked at the University of Kentucky Computer Vision laboratory and was advised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/).

# Research Interests:
Developing **deep learning** methods to address challenges in latent information representation from multiple sources, including point clouds images, and audio. More generally, I am interested in **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **reinforcement learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **remote sensing**, and **robotics**.
